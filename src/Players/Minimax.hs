{-
The idea of the Result datatype is that you can use it to keep track of sequences of actions as you traverse your evaluation tree. 
Then you'll end up choosing the result with the "best" score according to minimax. And that will come with a list of actions. 
Then you have to decide which of those actions should be returned. Does that make sense?
