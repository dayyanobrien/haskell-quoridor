*** PART III (10 pt) ***

Is it a good idea to start the game with the Reed opening?

There is a variety of ways I went about for testing the Reed opening, they involved, for both the starting and second
player, Reed v Minimax, Reed v Human and Human v Human (where one user plays as Reed). The variety of these allowed a 
strong analysis of this opening in both general theory and by actually putting the AI's against each other. 

I believe the idea behind Reed is such that it allows you good support from behind while also limiting the paths for the 
opposing player in order to reach the end which is significantly helpful in Quoridor, however with my analysis below you 
can see that this wouldn't be effective against an advanced player.

Overall upon testing this seems like a bad opening as both the first and second player. Where reed starts you can simply 
push forward and because the gap is just one block it will be very difficult for the enemy to block you off, and if they 
do manage to block you off they will have significantly less walls while you are also closer to the winning positions. 
While when you are the second player you are the second player you can push forward and have some walls that only make it
more difficult for the enemy player to get toward their own winning positions. Through my minimax testing, I found that 
the enemy player consistently beat the Reed player, regardless of the order.
